We have the static application lets make it more dynamic

to add an event listener we call it the document in normal js code or get the element
but in react we call it in the JS code

//In ExpenseItem.js

// <button onClick={() => {console.log("Clicked")}}>This is the button</button>

create a const in same file

 const Clickhandler = () => {
        return console.log("Clicked");
    }


    <button onClick={() => {Clickhandler}>This is the button</button>
